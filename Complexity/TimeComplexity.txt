Time complexity is determined by counting the number of fundamental operations an algorithm performs as the input size grows.
 steps to calculate the TimeComplexity
 1. Identify the size of the input (n):
 2.Count the number of operations:
 3.Avoid the Constant
 4.avoid the Lower Value


 Time Complexity	          Description	                                        Example
O(1)	           Constant time: the runtime is independent of input size.	   Accessing an element in an array by index
O(n)	           Linear time: the runtime grows linearly with input size.	   A for loop that iterates over all n elements in an array
O(nÂ²)	           Quadratic time: the runtime grows proportionally            Nested loops over an array
                   to the square of input size.
                                                               
O(log n)	      Logarithmic time: the runtime grows logarithmically           Binary search
                   with input size.	                        
O(n log n)	      Linearithmic time: the runtime grows linearly                	Efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort
                  times a logarithmic factor.
