Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm or data structure relative to the size of the input data

How to Calculate Space Complexity
Space complexity is typically measured using Big-O notation, where:

O(1): Constant space (no additional space needed).
O(n): Linear space (additional space grows linearly with the input size).
O(nÂ²): Quadratic space (space grows as the square of the input size), etc.
