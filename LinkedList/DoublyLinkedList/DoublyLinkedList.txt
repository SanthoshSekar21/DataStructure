A Doubly Linked List (DLL) is a type of linked list in which each node contains three fields:

Data: The value of the node.

Next: A pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.

Previous: A pointer (or reference) to the previous node in the sequence.

This structure allows traversal in both directions—forward and backward—unlike a Singly Linked List, which can only be traversed in one direction.

--------------------Structure of a Doubly Linked List:---------
Each node has a reference to both its successor (next node) and its predecessor (previous node).

The first node’s previous pointer is null, indicating the start of the list.

The last node’s next pointer is null, indicating the end of the list.
